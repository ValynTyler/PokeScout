#  Features
## Read NFC tag data
Scanning a valid NFC tag should open the data reader app and/or populate the desired fields with data.
## Initialize NFC tag data
Trainer tags should be able to be written to and initialized so that they can then be read and their relevant stats be updated.
## Update variable data fields
Tags should hold data like current XP and badges. That data should be conditionally updated from the leader app.
